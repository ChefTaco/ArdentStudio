## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Service foundation: Hono API under `/api/ardentstudio/v1`, fail-fast configuration,
  Oathweave resource-token verification (audience `ardentstudio`) with explicit identity
  links, append-only audit and `x-idempotency-key` on every mutation.
- SQLite schema (WAL, numbered additive migrations) for every Studio record, prefixed
  ULID identifiers and a per-project event feed with seq assigned in the inserting transaction.
- Content-addressed blob store with temp-file, fsync, rename and SHA-256 verification.
- Clients for Magnus (service identity, acting subject, released Ardent routes and the
  planned Studio routes), HiveMem (project workspaces and knowledge source sync) and an
  optional ChatterMost incoming webhook.
- Routes for health, projects, files with HiveMem knowledge sync, versioned templates with
  the Research Team, Development Team, Adventure Studio and Deliberation Panel seeds, team assignment
  (draft, validate, publish, apply template, save as template), agents through Magnus, and
  the project event stream (SSE with replay, heartbeat and reset).
- Zod browser contract (`src/shared/browser.ts`) and the generated
  `docs/openapi-browser.json`, with a staleness check.
- Container image (non-root, no package managers at runtime, `/data` volume), CI and a
  publish workflow for npm trusted publishing and GHCR.
